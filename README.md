## Introduction

This code aims to analyze and visualize the Airbnb listings data to gain insights into the various aspects of the listings. The code performs data cleaning, missing value handling, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.

## Getting Started

To run the code and replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).
3. Set the `directory_path` variable to the appropriate directory where your data is located.
4. Adjust the `filepath` variable to point to the correct CSV file containing the Airbnb listings data.
5. Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook).

## Code Explanation

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Import necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. **File Discovery**: Use the `os.walk` function to loop through the directory and print the filenames.

3. **Loading Data**: Load the Airbnb listings data into a Pandas DataFrame and display its basic information.

4. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and drop unnecessary columns.

5. **Data Visualization**: Create various visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore the dataset's attributes.

6. **Summary Statistics**: Calculate and visualize summary statistics of numeric columns.

7. **Data Transformation**: Convert columns to categorical, clean column names, and perform text replacements.

8. **Visualization**: Create histograms, box plots, and more to visualize data distributions and relationships.

9. **Data Aggregation**: Group and aggregate data to calculate mean prices and visualize them.

10. **Top Host Analysis**: Identify top host IDs and their associated neighborhoods.

## Usage

This code is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the process of EDA using Python. You can use this code as a reference for your own EDA projects or adapt it for different datasets. Make sure to customize directory paths and file paths according to your setup.
